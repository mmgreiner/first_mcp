# MCP datatypes

Taken from ChatGPT

When developing an **MCP (Modular Component Protocol)** server ‚Äî assuming you are referring to the **OpenAI's tool-calling interface via the API**, also known as **"function calling"** or **"tool use"** in the context of GPT models ‚Äî the arguments to tool calls are defined using **JSON Schema**.

This means the supported data types for the arguments are based on **JSON Schema** standards.

---

### ‚úÖ Supported Data Types

You can use the following **basic JSON Schema types** when defining tool parameters:

| JSON Schema Type | Description                        | Example              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `string`         | A sequence of characters           | `"hello"`            |
| `number`         | A number (integer or float)        | `3.14`               |
| `integer`        | A whole number                     | `42`                 |
| `boolean`        | A true/false value                 | `true`, `false`      |
| `array`          | A list of values                   | `[1, 2, 3]`          |
| `object`         | A key-value map (nested structure) | `{ "x": 1, "y": 2 }` |
| `null`           | A null value (not commonly used)   | `null`               |

---

### üîÅ Common Schema Constructs

You can also use common JSON Schema features like:

* `enum` ‚Äì Restrict a value to a fixed set of strings or numbers

  ```json
  { "type": "string", "enum": ["low", "medium", "high"] }
  ```

* `default` ‚Äì Provide a default value

  ```json
  { "type": "string", "default": "en" }
  ```

* `required` ‚Äì Specify required fields inside objects

* `items` ‚Äì Define types of items in arrays

  ```json
  {
    "type": "array",
    "items": { "type": "string" }
  }
  ```

* `properties` ‚Äì Define fields of an object

---

### üß† GPT Understanding and Usage

When GPT is invoking your tool (function), it uses its internal understanding of your schema to fill in the appropriate values. So:

* **Nested structures (objects within objects)** are supported
* **Arrays of objects or primitives** are supported
* The model will respect `enum`, `required`, etc., to shape its tool call

---

### Example Tool Definition

Here‚Äôs a full example of a tool definition with all supported types:

```json
{
  "name": "create_event",
  "description": "Creates a calendar event",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "title": { "type": "string" },
      "start_time": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
      "duration_minutes": { "type": "integer" },
      "is_virtual": { "type": "boolean", "default": true },
      "attendees": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "location": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "address": { "type": "string" },
          "room": { "type": "string" }
        },
        "required": ["address"]
      }
    },
    "required": ["title", "start_time"]
  }
}
```

---

### ‚ùó Not Supported

* Non-JSON-native types (like `Date` objects, binary blobs, etc.)
* Custom types not serializable to JSON
* Circular references in object schemas

---

If you‚Äôre developing this in a specific language or framework (e.g., Python with FastAPI, Node.js, etc.), I can help you generate valid schemas for those environments too.

Would you like help generating or validating a specific schema for your MCP server?

In the **MCP / tool calling interface** (based on **JSON Schema**), when you define a `string` type, you can optionally provide a **`format`** to specify that the string must follow a certain structure.

These formats are **advisory** for the AI model (like GPT-4), and they help guide the model to produce strings in the expected format. However, enforcement depends on your backend validation ‚Äî the model won't strictly enforce formats but will try to follow them when making tool calls.

---

### ‚úÖ Commonly Supported `format` Values for Strings

Here are the formats officially defined in JSON Schema (and recognized by OpenAI‚Äôs API for tool calls):

| Format      | Description                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `date`      | Full date only (YYYY-MM-DD)                                 |
| `time`      | Time only (HH:MM:SS)                                        |
| `date-time` | Full date + time with timezone (ISO 8601)                   |
| `email`     | Email address                                               |
| `uri`       | A valid URI (e.g., `https://example.com`)                   |
| `hostname`  | A valid domain name                                         |
| `ipv4`      | IPv4 address (e.g., `192.168.0.1`)                          |
| `ipv6`      | IPv6 address                                                |
| `uuid`      | A UUID (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`)       |
| `regex`     | A regular expression pattern string (JavaScript-flavor)     |
| `binary`    | Binary data (rarely used; not well supported in tool calls) |
| `password`  | A password (not validated for strength; mostly a UI hint)   |

---

### üß† Practical Use in Tool Calling

In the context of GPT tool calls:

* `date`, `time`, `date-time` are very useful for scheduling, calendar tools, etc.
* `email`, `uri`, `uuid` are helpful for contact info or linking entities.
* GPT is quite good at generating ISO 8601 datetime strings when `format: date-time` is used.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "format": "date-time",
  "description": "Start time of the meeting in ISO 8601 format"
}
```

GPT might produce: `"2025-09-25T15:00:00Z"`

---

### ‚ùó Custom Formats

OpenAI‚Äôs tool calling does **not** currently support custom `format` values beyond the standard JSON Schema ones. If you specify something like:

```json
{ "type": "string", "format": "phone-number" }
```

‚Ä¶it will **not be enforced or recognized** unless your server does custom validation. GPT may still guess what you mean, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed.

---

### üîç Summary

Supported `string` formats in tool calls (as per JSON Schema):

* `"date"`
* `"time"`
* `"date-time"`
* `"email"`
* `"uri"`
* `"hostname"`
* `"ipv4"`
* `"ipv6"`
* `"uuid"`
* `"regex"`
* `"binary"` (not useful in GPT context)
* `"password"` (UI hint only)

If you want help building a schema with these or testing how GPT responds to them, I can help with examples.

Great question ‚Äî and the correct answer is:

### ‚úÖ It's called **`pattern`**, not `regex`.

In **JSON Schema** (which OpenAI‚Äôs tool calling is based on), the keyword for specifying a regular expression for a string is:

```json
"pattern": "<your-regular-expression>"
```

There is **no** official `"regex"` format. If you use `"format": "regex"`, it will **not** define a regex constraint ‚Äî it would just mean the string *represents* a regex (e.g., a pattern string like `^\w+$`), not that it *is validated by* one.

---

### ‚úÖ Correct Example:

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "pattern": "^[A-Z]{3}\\d{3}$",
  "description": "Product code in the format AAA123"
}
```

---

### ‚ùå Incorrect:

```json
{
  "type": "string",
  "format": "regex"  // This does NOT enforce a regex pattern
}
```

That would be interpreted as "this string represents a regular expression", not that it should be validated against one.

---

### Summary

| Purpose                          | JSON Schema Keyword                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Validate a string with a regex   | ‚úÖ `pattern`                               |
| Indicate the string *is* a regex | üü° `format: "regex"` (not for validation) |

So for tool calling schemas:
‚úÖ Use `"pattern"` to apply regex-based validation or hints to the model.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like help writing a specific regex for your use case.
